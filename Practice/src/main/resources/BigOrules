Rules consider when caluclate BigO notations:
1.Consider worst case'
2.Drop constansts
3.Different variants for different inputs means if two loops of different size are using then big) will be O(n+m)
4.Drop dominats means if we found n^2+3n+100+n/2 in such case ignore rest excluding n^2 as the n increases n^2 will
 increase more than rest of the values so consider n^2 as bigO.

 If two loops are iterated one after other then bigO will be
 O(size of 1st array + size of 2nd array)

 It they are nested loops then BigO will be
 O(size of array * size of array)
